This project is **Day 7** of my **[#30DaysOfVibeCoding](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shvbhi)** challenge.

## üöÄ About The Project

Tired of just numbers? GitHub Unwrapped transforms a user's public GitHub activity into a visually appealing and personalized dashboard. Enter a username and get an instant, shareable summary of their coding journey, including their most used languages, contribution patterns, and most-starred projects.

This project was built to go beyond a simple frontend challenge, integrating a serverless backend to securely handle API requests and delivering a polished, professional-grade user experience.

## üåü Features

*   **Personalized Stats Card:** Generates a card with the user's profile picture, name, and key metrics like total repositories and stars.
*   **Contribution Calendar:** A full, interactive contribution calendar, just like the one on GitHub profiles.
*   **Top Repositories:** Ranks and displays the user's top 5 most-starred repositories with descriptions and direct links.
*   **Language Breakdown:** Visualizes the user's most frequently used languages with a clean, dynamic bar chart.
*   **Responsive Design:** A beautiful, multi-column grid layout on desktop that gracefully collapses to a single column on mobile devices.
*   **Shareable Content:** Built-in "Share on X" button to make sharing results effortless.
